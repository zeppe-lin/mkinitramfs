This directory contains mkinitramfs, the tool used to create a Linux
boot image (initramfs).

It is a fork of illiliti's tinyramfs.  Original sources can be
downloaded from:

  1. https://github.com/illiliti/tinyramfs
  2. https://github.com/illiliti/tinyramfs/archive/8abfcc9/tinyramfs-8abfcc9.zip

Features:

  * No "local"s, no bashisms, only POSIX shell.
  * Portable, no distro specific.
  * Easy to use configuration.
  * Build time and init time hooks.
  * LUKS (detached header, key, password), LVM.
  * smdev, mdev, mdevd, eudev, systemd-udevd.

In build time there are the following dependencies:

  - make(1p)
  - pod2man(1pm)

In runtime there are the following dependencies:

  - sh(1p) POSIX utilities, switch_root(8), mount(8), cpio(1).

  - ldd(1) is optional, required for copying binary dependencies.

  - strip(1p) is optional, required for reducing image size by
    stripping binaries.

  - blkid(8) is optional, required for UUID, LABEL, PARTUUID support.

  - smdev OR mdev OR mdevd OR eudev OR systemd-udevd OR
    CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER is/are optional, required for modular kernel,
    /dev/mapper/* and /dev/disk/*).

  - lvm(8) is optional, required for LVM support.

  - cryptsetup(8) is optional, required for LUKS support.

  - busybox' loadkmap is optional, required for keymap support.

  - kmod OR busybox' modutils with modprobe-kernel-version.patch
    is/are optional, not required for monolithic kernel.

To use mkinitramfs, read mkinitramfs.config(5) and setup
/etc/mkinitramfs/config file conform your needs.  Next, run as root:

  # mkinitramfs -o "/boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img"

Then update your bootloader config (i.e. grub):

  # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

And reboot.
