mkinitramfs - tiny initramfs generator
======================================
mkinitramfs is a tool used to create a Linux boot image (initramfs).

This mkinitramfs distribution is a fork of illiliti's tinyramfs as of
commit 8abfcc9 (Fri May 21 2021).  The man pages have been completely
rewritten.  Added `smdev` hooks.  `Luks` hooks have been modified to
ask the password if header/key-file is not defined.  Added `resume`
hook to resume machines from hibernation.  Added a possibility to copy
`modprobe.d` configuration files.  Added bash completion.

- make(1p)
- podchecker(1p) and pod2man(1p) from perl distribution

Runtime:
- sh(1p), POSIX utilities, switch_root(8), mount(8), cpio(1)
- ldd(1) is optional, required for copying binary dependencies.
- strip(1p) is optional, required for reducing image size by
  stripping binaries.
- blkid(8) is optional, required for UUID, LABEL, PARTUUID support.
- smdev OR mdev OR mdevd OR eudev OR systemd-udevd OR
