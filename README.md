OVERVIEW
========

The `mkinitramfs` utility generates a bootable initramfs image for
Linux systems.

It is a fork of illiliti's `tinyramfs` at commit `8abfcc9`
(Fri May 21 2021), with the following changes:
  * Bash completion support
  * GNU-style options and usage output
  * Command-line parsing via GNU `getopt(1)`
  * Use of `local` to prevent namespace pollution
  * Support for `rootdelay` kernel parameter
  * Experimental `smdev` hook
  * `luks` hook: prompts for password if header/keyfile is missing
  * `extrafiles` directive: copy arbitrary files into image
  * `resume` hook: supports hibernation resume from swap partitions or
    files
  * Split `keymap` hook into `loadkmap` and `loadkeys` (supports
    BusyBox and kmod)

See git log for full history.

FEATURES
========

The following advantages can be distinguished:
  * no bashisms, only POSIX `sh(1p)` (with `local` exception)
  * portable, no distro specific
  * easy to use configuration
  * build-time and init-time hooks
  * LUKS (detached header, key, password), LVM
  * smdev, mdev, mdevd, eudev, systemd-udevd


REQUIREMENTS
============

Kernel
------

You need a kernel built with the following features (statically or as
modules):

    General setup
      [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
          CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
        
    Device Drivers
      Generic Driver Options
        [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
            CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y

To use `mkinitramfs(8)` with encrypted root is needed to include the
following features too:

    Device Drivers --->
      Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->
        [*] Device mapper support
        [*] Crypt target support
        
    Cryptographic API --->
      <*> XTS support
      <*> SHA224 and SHA256 digest algorithm
      <*> AES cipher algorithms
      <*> AES cipher algorithms (x86_64)
      <*> User-space interface for hash algorithms
      <*> User-space interface for symmetric key cipher algorithms

Build time
----------
  * POSIX `sh(1p)`, `make(1p)` and "mandatory utilities"
  * `scdoc(1)` to build manual pages

Runtime
-------
  * Any POSIX-compatible shell with `local` variables support, like
    `dash(1)`, busybox `ash(1)`, etc
  * GNU `getopt(1)`, `switch_root(8)`, `mount(8)`, `cpio(1)`

The following runtime dependencies are optional:

  * `ldd(1)`: for copying binary dependencies
  * `strip(1p)`: for reducing image size by stripping binaries
  * `blkid(8)`: for UUID, LABEL, PARTUUID support
  * `smdev` OR `mdev` OR `mdevd` OR `eudev` OR `systemd-udevd` or
    `CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER`: for modular kernel, `/dev/mapper/` and
    `/dev/disk/`
  * `lvm(8)`: for LVM support
  * `cryptsetup(8)`: for LUKS support
  * busybox's `loadkmap` or kbd's `loadkeys(8)`: for keymap support
  * `kmod(8)` OR busybox' modutils+[patch][1]: for non-monolithic
    kernel

INSTALL
=======

To install this package, run:

    make install

See `config.mk` file for configuration parameters.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Basic usage
-----------

Setup `/etc/mkinitramfs/config` file conform your needs (see
`mkinitramfs.config(5)` for more information how to do it).

Next, generate the initramfs:

    sudo mkinitramfs -o "/boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img"

Then update your bootloader configuration.  The following example is
for GRUB2:

    sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Reboot.

Manual pages are in `/man`.
